# 🏏  IPL-AUCTION-2025-SPEND-BY-EACH-TEAM-MINI-PROJECT🏏

Welcome to the **2025 IPL Auction Team Purchase Secrets Strategy Analysis Project!** This is my **first-ever coding project** built from scratch to predict and analyze IPL team purchases during the **2025 auction** 🏆. With the help of Python and its powerful modules, I've developed a comprehensive analysis approach involving **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, **Feature Engineering**, and the creation of an **Advanced Machine Learning Model** to predict and analyze the auction decisions. 🚀

## 📊 **What Is This Project About?**

This project dives deep into the **IPL Auction data** trending on Kaggle, where the goal is to unravel hidden patterns and strategies behind team purchases at the auction. I used cutting-edge data science techniques to **predict team strategies**, make data-driven insights, and **recommend optimal purchases** during the auction.

### Key Features:
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the dataset with detailed insights, distribution analysis, and feature relationships.
- 🧩 **Feature Engineering**: Building meaningful features for better prediction accuracy.
- 🤖 **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Predicting auction outcomes using various algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost, and more.
- 📈 **Visualization**: A comprehensive set of visualizations to showcase key trends in IPL auction history.

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Tools Used**

- **Python**: My go-to programming language for data science and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations that reveal patterns in the data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building machine learning models to predict IPL auction outcomes.
- **XGBoost**: Used for creating highly efficient, gradient-boosted models.
- **Kaggle Dataset**: The dataset used for this project is trending on Kaggle and is publicly available.

## 🔍 **What I Did in This Project:**

1. 🧑‍💻 **Data Collection**: I started by collecting the **2025 IPL auction data** from Kaggle, which includes historical auction data of players and teams.
   
2. 🔎 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Analyzed the data to discover key insights and correlations.
    - Unveiled the **team strategies**, such as their **preferred types of players**, **budget allocation**, and other decision-making patterns. 🧠

3. 🛠️ **Feature Engineering**:
    - Created several **new features** that would enhance the accuracy of the model, such as:
      - Player performance metrics 📊
      - Auction success ratio 🏅
      - Team budget efficiency 💰

4. 🤖 **Building Machine Learning Models**:
    - Used **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** to predict player purchases.
    - Tuned hyperparameters to improve model performance.
    - Validated the model using **cross-validation** to ensure robustness.

5. 📉 **Performance Evaluation**:
    - Evaluated the models using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** metrics. 📊
    - Generated **confusion matrices** and **ROC curves** for model evaluation. 📈

6. 🎯 **Prediction & Strategy**:
    - Generated predictions for team strategies in the upcoming IPL 2025 auction.
    - Analyzed the predictions to suggest the best strategy for each team based on historical trends and data. 🏏
